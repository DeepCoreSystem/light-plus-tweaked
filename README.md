This is just some minor tweaks to the Light+ theme.

Since people have asked for settings used in the screenshot...

* The font used is [Input Mono](https://input.fontbureau.com/download/). A nice and free font for private use. The version I use is a modified version with ligatures added (I used [Ligaturizer](https://github.com/ToxicFrog/Ligaturizer) to do this).
* The file icon theme is [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme)

This theme is just a UI tweak of the default Light+ theme from Microsoft.
